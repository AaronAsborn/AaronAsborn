## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

How to work around with the flexbox. Working through the task I have came to know of the uses of justify and align.


**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own learnings.**

### Continued development

I seek to polish up on my flexbox uses and then move on to the grid properties

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJZv4d5rbIKd4QHMPkcABCw) - This helped me become familar with same terms in CSS display. Same of them are Display, position, and margin. 
- [Example resource 2](https://www.bitdegree.org/learn/css-display) - This is an amazing site which helped me finally understand flexbox. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
